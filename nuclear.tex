\subsection{Nuclear interactions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scattering  phase shifts of $NN$ systems. validation of LQCD calculations at physical point. Understanding role of Coloumb, eg $a_{pp}$ vs $a_{np}$ vs $a_{nn}$ in the spin singlet channel.
	\item Scattering phase shifts for  hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon systems. Input to nuclear equation of state (EoS) for potential hyperonic matter in neutron stars; connection to NS-NS mergers and NICER.
	\item Three body forces. Experminetal constrain in particular on $nnn$ interactions is bore but increasingly relevnat in larger nuclei. Most direct constrain is from EFT matching to finite volume energy levels computed in LQCD
	\item Interaction of light nuclei with electroweak probes
