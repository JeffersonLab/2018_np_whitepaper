\begin{itemize}
	\item Spectroscopy of light nuclei: physical mass calculations of $A<5$ nuclei
	\item Exploratory calculations of larger nuclei with strong motivation for $^6$Li as it is spin-1, also for other $p$-shell nuclei as they probe aspects of nuclear forces 
	\item Try to look at states that have complex structures at the physical masses (eg halo for ${}^6$He, deformations) though presumably many small effects important 
	\item Understand quark mass dependence of nuclear physics
	\item FV energy levels matching to effective field theories in FV. 
	
\end{itemize}






\subsection{Nuclear interactions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scattering  phase shifts of $NN$ systems. validation of LQCD calculations at physical point. Understanding role of Coulomb, eg $a_{pp}$ vs $a_{np}$ vs $a_{nn}$ in the spin singlet channel.
	\item Scattering phase shifts for  hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon systems. Input to nuclear equation of state (EoS) for potential hyperonic matter in neutron stars; connection to NS-NS mergers and NICER.
	\item Three and four body forces. Experimental constrain in particular on $nnn$ interactions is poor but increasingly relevant in larger nuclei. Most direct constrain is from EFT matching to finite volume energy levels computed in LQCD. Multiple EFT groups using unphysical mass lattice calculations to do this right now:LANL, Hagen/ORNL (pion-full), Lovato/Pederiva, Van Kolck using different EFT formulations
	\item Interaction of light nuclei with electroweak probes: $np\to d\gamma$, $pp\to de^+\nu$, ... 
	Important to extract two, three body current contributions as one-body pieces presumably better known from single nucleon calculations/experiment.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Nuclear Structure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Explore nuclear modification of hadron structure. Modifications of charges, form factors, moments of PDFs  (derive the EMC effect from QCD). 
	Do this with complete flavour breakdown
	\item Determine spatial pictures of nuclei from ``charge distributions'' as Fourier transforms of various form factors. Radii
	\item Study $x$-dependent PDFs, gluonic aspects of hnuclear structure
	\item Exotic glue
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Nuclear input for neutrino physics and fundamental symmetries}

Primarily link to other white papers
\begin{itemize}
	\item nuclear matrix elements for experiment interpretation (DM searches, nu-nucleus scattering,â€¦)
	\item dark matter matrix elems [passing connection to other doc by Zoreh/Taku], mu2e matrx elements
	\item Precision spectroscopy (Yotam), 
\end{itemize}
