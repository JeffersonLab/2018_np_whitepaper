Title: Hadrons and Nuclei

The authors discuss the possibilities of using lattice QCD to investigate the
structure of hadrons and nuclei from the perspective of the USQCD  
collaboration. This white paper contains a large number of interesting
topics and outlooks for future LQCD investigations. However, it falls
short in discussing some relevant issues and at places, the discussions
are rather simplified or even misleading. In addition, a number of relevant
references are missing. In particular:

o In Sec. 2.1, the computation of the proton charge radius is mentioned.
 Just calculating the isovector radius is not sufficient, one also needs
 to determine the isoscalar one. While this is much more challenging, it
 needs at least to be mentioned.

REPLY: As discussed, the isovector radius can be combined with the precise neturon charge radius to constrain the proton charge radius. We have added a sentence 'The full set of flavor separated contributions to the charge radius are also being determined by various groups, although with less precision than the isovector quantity.' at the end of the relevant paragraph


o In the same section, the use of external field techniques and/or the
 Feynman-Hellmann theorem to extract  polarisabilities and alike is
 discussed. Some missing references are:

 A.~J.~Chambers et al., PoS LATTICE {\bf 2015} (2016) 125
 A.~Agadjanov, U.~G.~Meißner and A.~Rusetsky, Phys. Rev. D 95 (2017) 031502
 A.~Agadjanov, U.~G.~Meißner and A.~Rusetsky, Phys. Rev. D 99 (2019) 054501


REPLY: we have added these references


o The discussion of the scalar mesons f0(980) and a0(980) is not up-to-date.
 There exits model-independent methods based on Weinberg's compositeness
 criterion that clearly indicate that these are molecules, see e.g.

 V.~Baru et al., Phys. Lett. B 586 (2004) 53
 F.~K.~Guo et al., Rev. Mod. Phys. 90 (2018)  015004

REPLY: Citation added - mentioned below.


o The discussion of the spectrum before sec. 3.1 is also incomplete. There are
 not only the XYZ states that challenge the conventional quark model, but
 rather also the charm-strange mesons. Their properties can only be explained
 in a molecular picture, see the review just mentioned. Further, COMPASS has
 also shown clear evidence of non-conventional states, see
 M.~Alekseev et al. [COMPASS Collaboration], Phys.Rev.Lett. 104 (2010) 241803

REPLY: This section is not a comprehensive review of the field. The COMPASS results are described in the Lebed (2017) review. We have added a citation to the Guo paper mentioned above as it provides a review of different possible mechanisms in the heavy quark sector.


o In the discussion of the Luescher formalism and its extensions on page 9,
 two important papers are missing:

 M.~Lage, U.~G.~Meissner and A.~Rusetsky, Phys. Lett. B 681 (2009) 439
 M.~Gockeler et al., Phys. Rev. D 86 (2012) 094513

REPLY: We added a citation to the Gockeler paper. The Lage paper was already cited in this section.



o The discussion of the use of the coupled-channel S-matrix is not entirely
 convincing. It is not sufficient to use a large number of K-matrix
 parametrizations or alike to avoid potential bias. This is most clearly seen
 in the beautiful anaylsis of M.~Albaladejo et al, Phys. Lett. B 767 (2017)
 465, which used unitarized chiral perturbation theory (UChPT) in a finite
 volume to re-analyse the fine data from the HadSpec Collaboration, finding
 two poles for the D_0^*(2400), where as HadSpec had only given one in their
 JHEP paper. In general, UChPT needs to be mentioned in this context, one
 early reference is M.~Doring et al., Eur. Phys. J. A {\bf 47} (2011) 139.


REPLY: A discussion and references have been added.

o In the discussion of methods to deal with form factors and transitions,
 a few more references are in order, especially

 V. Bernard et al., JHEP 1209 (2012) 023 
 A. Agadjanov  et al.,  Nucl. Phys. B 886 (2014) 1199


REPLY: We have added these and several other references on the finite-volume formalism for 1->2 transition matrix elements in Sec. 3.1.



o The final paragraph of stating on page 10 is also a bit optimistic. There
 are to few resonances calculated in lattice QCD so far that one can really
 avoid models. It is still a long way. In this context, under future
 opportunities I miss completely the omega and phi mesons and the Roper
 resonance. These should be the prime targets of lattice QCD in the years
 to come if one really wants to claim that one is on the way of calculating
 the spectrum!

REPLY: A discussion of baryons has been added.

o In the discussion of the formalism for three-hadrons states, important
 references are missing:

 H. W. Hammer et al., JHEP  1709 (2017)
 H. W. Hammer et al., JHEP  1710 (2017)


REPLY: These references have been added.


o The discussion in the beginning of 3.2 do not reflect properly the
 state-of-the-art. Charged Z-states must be tetraquarks or molecules,
 they can not be conventional charmonium states. And to assign the
 relevance of cusp structure to one US author [220] is utterly incorrect,
 see e.g.

 F.~K.~Guo et al., Phys. Rev. D {\bf 92} (2015) 071502
 F.~K.~Guo,   PoS Hadron {\bf 2017} (2018) 015

 and, of course, earlier work by Schmidt, Hoehler and others in the 1960ties!

REPLY: The text already states that the system must have minimal four quark content. These are interesting references about pentaquarks, and yes these references discuss cusps, but the section is about how LQCD can inform us on the content of the XYZ-s. Discussion of pentaquarks is later in the section.



o When it comes to nuclei in section 4, the whole discussion is rather
 optimistic (or should I say: naive?). Lattice QCD is far from doing
 any realistic calculation of even a light nucleus like 12C. So
 one needs to look for alternatives. The authors discuss the matching
 of heavy pion mass results to pionless EFT, which I consider not
 the right path. May it as it is, the most precise nuclear structure
 method is  undoubtedly NLEFT, which, however, would also require some
 input for certain couplings from lattice QCD. This path should at
 least be mentioned (if not followed).

REPLY: We agree studying nuceli is ambitious, but there is reason for optimism.
We have added a caveat to at the end of the following sentence: 'Larger nuclei also exhibit interesting collective effects such as halo structures (eg,  ${}^{6,8}$He), cluster structures (eg ${}^{8}$Be, ${}^{12}$C) and deformations that would be very instructive to see emerge from LQCD calculations, although significant algorithmic advances will be required to reach such systems.'

We agree NLEFT is a promising approach that could also be matched on to LQCD calcualtions in light nuclei. We are not aware of any NLEFT works that do that so far. We have added a reference to a recent review:
@article{Lahde:2019npb,
	author         = "Lähde, Timo A. and Meißner, Ulf-G.",
	title          = "{Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory}",
	journal        = "Lect. Notes Phys.",
	volume         = "957",
	year           = "2019",
	pages          = "1-396",
	doi            = "10.1007/978-3-030-14189-9",
	SLACcitation   = "%%CITATION = LNPHA,957,1;%%"
}

o On top of page 14, studies of meson systems are discussed. One important
 paper is completely missed:

 F.~Romero-López, A.~Rusetsky and C.~Urbach, Eur. Phys. J. C78 (2018) 846

REPLY: While the reference is interesting, it is for phi^4 theory rather than QCD and we choose
not to include it.


o In the context of quark mass variations and the origin of carbon and
 oxygen, the authors could quote the recent update based on NLEFT:

 T.~A.~Lähde, U.~G.~Meißner and E.~Epelbaum, arXiv:1906.00607 [nucl-th].

REPLY: We have added this reference, writing 'Effective field theory constrains on the effects of quark mass variation on nuclear spectroscopy have been recently summarised in Ref.~\cite{Lahde:2019yvr}.'


o In the discussion of radiative capture on the and deuteron break-up by
 low-energy photons, there are not only phenomenological models and
 lattice QCD. Pionless and chiral EFT are the main players here for
 precision calculations. This should be stated. In this context, assuming
 that operators depend mildly on the quark masses (so as to go down
 from mpi = 800 MEV to the physical value) has no basis in QCD, it is
 just a guess (which might be wrong). Studies of two, three and four-nucleon
 systems in chiral EFT rather seem to indicate the opposite, see the
 famous paper E.~Braaten and H.~W.~Hammer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 (2003) 102002.

REPLY:
We have reformulated the appropriate sentence to more explicitly mention ChPT and pionless EFT: 'In nuclear potential models, such contributions are described by phenomenological meson-exchange currents, while in chiral perturbation theory and pionless effective field theory these enter as two-body contact operators.'
We stand by the statement that LQCD has shown the two-body contact operator to have approximately the same value at two, albeit heavy, quark masses corresponding o mpi=800 and 450 MeV as discussed in the text. We agree that the matrix element as a whole has significant mass dependence, but not the short distance two-body operator. The sentence now reads: 'Noting the weak mass dependence of the tow-body contact operator, the results were extrapolated to the physical pion mass, allowing the rate of the low-energy inelastic process to be determined 
at the physical point albeit with large uncertainties.'


o In the end of sec. 4.3, precision calculations of double beta decay operators
 are discussed. It should be mentioned that even though these can be
 calculated to high precision, no nuclear structure method so far is able
 to provide the corresponding matrix elements in a typical nucleus like Gd
 with any kind of precision (may be NLEFT in a few years).

REPLY: We have added the sentence - 'Achieving precision calculations in the large nuclei relevant for $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay experiments will also require significant developments in EFT and many-body methods.'



o In section 5, the authors make two statements/references that 
 completely misrepresent the history/developments. First, the claim
 that ``there is a need to include dispersive methods in the analysis
 of the factors...has been emphasized [305]". While the statement is
 correct, the reference is utterly inappropriate. First, the need for a
 dispersive treatment of the form factors to extract the proton and neutron
 radii has been stressed since decades (!) by the Bonn group, see e.g.
 M.~A.~Belushkin, H.-W.~Hammer and U.-G.~Meissner, Phys. Rev.C  75 (2007)
 035202, I.~T.~Lorenz, H.-W.~Hammer and U.~G.~Meissner, Eur. Phys. J. A 48
 (2012) 151, I.~T.~Lorenz et al., Phys. Rev D  91 (2015) 014023 (just to
 mention a few pertinent ones) and, second,  the spectral function in [305]
 is even wrong by about a factor of two, see e.g. the most recent and precise
 determination in  M.~Hoferichter et al.,  Eur. Phys. J. A  52 (2016) 331.
 So this needs to be rewritten. Second, and may be even worse, it is stated
 that the Hofstadter measurements in the mid 1950ties gave the
 first experimental evidence for the composite structure of the proton.
 That is WRONG! As one learns in quantum mechanics I, Otto Stern in 1933
 at Hamburg measured the Landé factor of the proton and found a large
 deviation from the Dirac theory. This was the first experimental evidence
 (not in the US, I add) of the composite structure of the proton. This
 needs to be corrected.

REPLY: We note that section 5, suggestively titled "Future Opportunities", highlights some particular class of calculations that USQCD members will pursue, and tries to give a notion of the computational complexity that is involved.

The passing statement in Section 5.1 that there have been advances in nuclear science has been changed from "the last 70 years" to the "the last century". The reference there is to the muonic hydrogen measurements which has caused a flurry of activity. The focus of that subsection, though, is about what LQCD can do. References mentioned above have been added to provide some more context regarding dispersive methods.


o Hadronic molecules are much more widespread than just for the XYZ states,
 see e.g. the scalar mesons mentioned or the two poles of the Lambda(1405).
 Here, again the Rev. Mod. Phys. by Guo et al. should be quoted.

REPLY: This section is describing a future opportunity to dissect the charmonium sector by trading off computational costs. The light quark mesons and baryons are described in Section 3.


o Finally, measuring energy levels of two- and three-nucleon systems to
 constrain (pionless) EFT forces is simply not enough to enable lattice
 QCD calculations of heavier nuclei as stated in 5.3. This needs some
 rewriting.

REPLY:

In summary, the paper can be published once the authors have addressed
these points.
