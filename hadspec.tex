\subsection{XYZ states}

\hide{
	Within the charm sector, the lattice QCD methods described above can be brought to bear on the question of flavor exotics and the other excess `XYZ' states. There have been suggestions that at least some of the observed enhancements arise due to the kinematics of the three-body production process (e.g. $e^+e^- \to J/\psi \, \pi \pi$ or $B \to K \, \psi' \pi$), rather than being due to a true two-body resonance. The lattice calculation has the advantage that it does not need to consider a particular production process, rather it can determine the two-body scattering amplitude directly, and thus investigate the resonance content.
