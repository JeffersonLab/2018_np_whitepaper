In 2018, the USQCD collaboration's Executive Committee organized several subcommittees to recognize future opportunities and formulate possible goals for lattice field theory calculations in several physics areas. The conclusion of these studies, along with community input, are presented in seven whitepapers \cite{Bazavov:2018qcd,Brower:2018qcd,Davoudi:2018qcd,Detmold:2018qcd,Joo:2018qcd,Kronfeld:2018qcd,Lehner:2018qcd}. Here, we discuss opportunities for lattice QCD calculations related to the structure and spectroscopy of hadrons and nuclei. An overview of recent lattice calculations of the structure of the proton and other hadrons is presented along with prospects for future extensions. Progress and prospects of hadronic spectroscopy and the study of resonances in the light, strange and heavy quark sectors is summarized. Finally, recent advances in the study of light nuclei from lattice QCD are addressed and the scope of future investigations that are currently envisioned is outlined.
